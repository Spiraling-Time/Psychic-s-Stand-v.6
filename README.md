You are a wizard trapped in a colosseum. You are nearly dead. However, you have enough magic to affect your ragdoll-esque body in bursts. Death is inevitable for all in this pit, but perhaps you can extend this nightmare. Every other contestant can attack, but you are simply another body as good as any other. Stay out of the way, survive.

Instructions:

Controls:

Arrow Keys/WASD, 

Enter or Click Pause to toggle it.

Stuff to Know:

Whenever you move, the pink bar drains. It will slowly regenerate when you don't press buttons, but if it ever reaches zero, it will pause before recharging. Try to stay above zero and you will be fine.

If your health runs out, you die. Duh.

HOWEVER, you can spend grit which you collect when you score points to prolong your life!

Be on the lookout for SOUL which will heal you, give you energy, and boost your points. SOUL will drop whenever most enemies die, and if they had collected soul they will drop more when they die.

(The quit button just freezes the game in this so reload if you hit it)

I added sound!
